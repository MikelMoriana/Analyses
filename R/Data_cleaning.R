# Other errors:
# 2021 Lav_2_2 (Kari) Ant_alp is actually Alc_alp. The Tar_sp is wrong, has the values from Bis_viv, There is Ver_alp in subplot 1 - Cover 1
# 2021 Lav_3_3 (Kari) Agr_cap in subplot 10. Car_big makes no sense either in the scan or in the file. Unknown is Suc vul, or something like that. Missing Car_nor_cf (which is Car_nor)
# There is one case of Pyr_rot with flower, Gud_7_4 in 2018. In 2023 it was called Pyr_rot, the other years Pyr_sp. I still call all Pyrola Pyr_sp, but we can discuss
